Firewall Configuration - Findings

1. UFW was installed and enabled on the system, confirming active firewall protection.

2. Rule added to ALLOW inbound SSH (port 22) for secure remote management:
   Command: sudo ufw allow 22
   Result: SSH connections permitted (shown in rule table and screenshot)

3. Rule added to DENY inbound Telnet (port 23) for security hardening:
   Command: sudo ufw deny 23
   Result: Telnet connections blocked (verified by failed telnet connection test)

4. Verified firewall rules using:
   Command: sudo ufw status numbered
   Result: Confirmed correct rule order and logic (ALLOW 22, DENY 23 for both IPv4 & IPv6)

5. Deleted the Allow 22 rule (#2):
   Command: sudo ufw delete 2
   Result: Rule for SSH port removed, visible in updated rule table

6. Re-tested Telnet connection using:
   Command: telnet localhost 23
   Result: Connection refused, confirming blockage by firewall rule

7. All changes and tests documented with screenshots of terminal, rule lists, and results.

Summary (Key Points):

- Telnet (port 23) was successfully blocked, enhancing system security.
- SSH (port 22) was allowed, maintaining secure administrative access until deleted for demonstration.
- Firewall rules were clearly visible and easily managed with UFW numbered status.
- All actions performed using straightforward UFW commands.
- Proper firewall configuration and testing is essential for any security posture audit.

End of findings.
